# `useLocalCredentials()`

The `useLocalCredentials()` allows you to store a user's password credentials on their device and later use biometrics to sign-in. This is enhances the UX of an application, since the next time the user needs to login they can simply use Face ID, or another biometric authentication method.

> [!WARNING]
> This API is available only for [@clerk/clerk-expo v2](/docs/upgrade-guides/expo-v2/upgrade).
> Be aware that this works only for sign in attempts with the password strategy.

## `useLocalCredentials()` returns

<Properties>
  - `hasCredentials`
  - `boolean`

  Indicates if there are any credentials stored on the device.

  ---

  - `userOwnsCredentials`
  - `boolean`

  ---

  - `setCredentials()`
  - <code>(params: [LocalCredentials](#local-credentials)) => Promise\<void></code>

  Stores the provided credentials on the device if the device has enrolled biometrics. The end user needs to have a passcode set in order for the credentials to be stored, and those credentials will be removed if the passcode gets removed. The promise will reject if value cannot be stored on the device.

  ---

  - `clearCredentials()`
  - <code>() => Promise\<void></code>

  Removes the stored credentials from the device. The promise will reject if value cannot be deleted from the device.

  ---

  - `authenticate()`
  - <code>() => Promise\<SignInResource></code>

  Attempts to read the stored credentials and creates a sign in attempt with the password strategy. A promise with a SignInResource if the stored credentials were accessed, otherwise the promise will reject.
