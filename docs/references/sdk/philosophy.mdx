description: The guiding principle for building a Clerk SDK.

# Philosophy

A reason why there’s not only a React SDK for Clerk but also a Next.js, Remix, and Astro one is that they’ll deliver a better integration than a general purpose SDK. Each framework has slightly different APIs, capabilities, and conventions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Optimize for the user’s developer experience.** These principles, conventions, and instructions below are not strict rules. Use your best judgement to adjust as needed. Adhere to what makes most sense for the programming language or framework.

Here’s a non-exhaustive list of things to take into consideration to deliver a great developer experience.

## Performance

Developers and marketers alike care about their website's [performance scoring](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring). Ensure efficient loading of your SDK and reduce bundle size & dependencies. Less dependencies also mean less maintenance and security concerns.

## Enable best practices

For your SDK, follow the framework's or language's best practices and consider using their specialized patterns over generalized ones (e.g. special script loading). For your users, provide APIs to leverage those best practices.

## Documentation

Spend time writing an exhaustive, yet organized `README` that enables your users to get started with your SDK. If you want to go above and beyond, create your own documentation site (recommended: [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/)). Provide examples on how to use your SDK, e.g. with a separate example repository.

## Convenience

Make SDK usage convenient. If the SDK can handle something under the hood which otherwise would require an action by the user, do it. Clerk's components are its API as that abstraction is powerful and convenient.

## Compatibility

Ensure compatibility with the upstream framework or language. Have reasonable backward compatibility.

## API surface

Keep the API surface small. Most often you’ll only need to expose the options for the underlying Clerk SDKs and pass those through.

## Testing

Add End-to-End tests to regularly test hot paths of your SDK. Functionality like sign-in, sign-up, and other UI components have high priority. Inside the [testing guide](https://clerk.com/docs/testing/overview) you'll learn how to use testing tokens and which testing utilities are available.
