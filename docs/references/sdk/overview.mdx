# SDK Development

The following is a guide for implementing a new Clerk SDK. The intention is to provide both internal and external contributors all the necessary information and guidance on how to build a new SDK from scratch.

Clerk believes that truly optimal DX can only be achieved by building SDKs independently for each framework. Each framework differentiates itself with nuanced patterns, and we need to make sure we lean into those patterns to avoid feeling like a square peg in a round hole.

> Need help while developing a new SDK? Join the #TODO channel on Discord to chat with fellow SDK maintainers and Clerk employees. You can also look at existing SDKs [on GitHub](https://github.com/clerk/javascript).

## Get started

Before you can start implementing a new Clerk SDK, you'll need to get accustomed with some prerequisites which will make it easier to follow the following instructions:

- [Terminology](/docs/references/sdk/terminology)
- [Philosophy](/docs/references/sdk/philosophy)
- [Conventions](/docs/references/sdk/conventions)
- [SDK Types](/docs/references/sdk/types)

## Guides

Afterwards you can dive into one of these guides to start developing your SDK:

- [Frontend-only SDK](/docs/references/sdk/frontend-only)
- [Backend-only SDK](/docs/references/sdk/backend-only)
- [Fullstack SDK](/docs/references/sdk/fullstack)
